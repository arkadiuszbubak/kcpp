 * \brief Static member function int C++
 * v0.01
 *
 *  By declaring a function member as static, you make it independent of any
 *  particular object of the class. A static member function can be called even
 *  if no objects of the class exist and the static functions are accessed using
 *  only the class name and the scope resolution operator ::.
 *  A static member function can only access:
 *  - static data member
 *  - other static member functions
 *  - any other functions from outside the class.
 *  Static member functions have a class scope and they do not have access to the this pointer of the class.
 *  You could use a static member function to determine whether some objects of
 *  the class have been created or not.
 *
 * Compare to the LStatic.cc
